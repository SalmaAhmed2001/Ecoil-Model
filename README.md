# Ecoil-Model

This Model defines a set of Metabolites for a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of Escherichia coli Using the COBRApy package in Python,
that is a constraint-based modeling package used to build and analyze genome-scale metabolic models.

Each metabolite in the code is defined by its formula, name, compartment, and abbreviation. The abbreviations represent the metabolites in the metabolic reactions that are part of the metabolic models.

Defining the Reactions of Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation

Defining Metabolic Pathways, Transport Reactions (Modeling the Exchange of CO2, Glucose, H+, H2O, Ammonia, and Oxygen), and Biomass Synthesis

Finally, the model is optimized using the optimize() method to find the maximum growth rate under the given conditions,
and the Code to save and load COBRApy models as JSON files. then  the Escher library for visualizing metabolic pathway maps, and create an empty map using the Escher Builder object.
