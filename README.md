# Ecoil-Model
This Model defines a set of Metabolites for a Genome-Scale Metabolic Model of Escherichia coli Using the COBRApy package in Python. 

COBRApy is a constraint-based modeling package that is used to build and analyze genome-scale metabolic models.

Each metabolite in the code is defined by its formula, name, compartment, and abbreviation. The abbreviations represent the metabolites in the metabolic reactions that are part of the metabolic models.

Defining the Reactions of Glycolysis, Pentose Phosphate Pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation

Defining Metabolic Pathways, Transport Reactions, and Biomass Synthesis

Transport Reactions in Escherichia coli: Modeling the Exchange of CO2, Glucose, H+, H2O, Ammonia, and Oxygen.

Finally, the model is optimized using the optimize() method to find the maximum growth rate under the given conditions.
